# altimeter
A couple of tools to work with HK-A altimeter.

I was bored because I didn't want to reboot my PC and start windows just to check the altimeter data. The official application works OK in linux with wine, but not so well if there is a lot of data to download from the altimeter.
So the first tool was born. It can download the altimeter contents, set sample rate and erase altimeter memory.

The second tool is more of a programming exercise. It's a java application to display HKA/FDA files (like the official tool) and eventually export/convert to CSV, XLSX, SQL, etc.

*I need to commit/push the java application and finish this file. I'm not planning to write docs, but will gladly answer any questions you might have*
